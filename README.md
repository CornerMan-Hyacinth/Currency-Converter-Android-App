# Currency-Converter-Android-App

This is an Android App calculates and converts a currency/crypto to another currency by utilizing APIs to retrieve real time price feeds.  
<br>
The frontend layout uses a Tab template to switch between currency and crypto conversion respectively.  
Each tab has a subsequent fragment: **FiatFragment** and **CryptoFragment** which contains the logic for calling the APIs, retrieving and displaying the responses.  
<br>  

**NOTE:** The API Keys used in this project are free so there was no use securing them. Be sure to secure yours in the case of commercial usage.  
When running the application, be sure to use the provided APIs economically for others that'd like to test it out too.  
<br>  
This is a very simple, understandable and replicable project. Be sure to forward your questions during hitches.
