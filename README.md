# Currency-Converter-Android-App

This project is an Android App that calculates and converts a currency/crypto to another currency by utilizing APIs to retrieve real time price feeds.  
<br>
The frontend layout uses a Tab template to switch between currency and crypto conversion respectively.  
Each tab has a subsequent fragment: **FiatFragment** and **CryptoFragment** which contains the logic for calling the APIs, retrieving and displaying the responses.  
<br>  

**NOTE:** The API Keys used in this project are free so there was no use securing them. Be sure to secure yours in the case of a paid usage.  
When running the application, be sure to call the provided APIs economically in view of others that'd like to test it out too.  
<br>  
This is a very simple, understandable and replicable project. Be sure to forward your questions during hitches.
